## Black Box Golf

Black Boxing is where a very complicated technology or system (like a computer or a bank) is simplified. In practice much technology we use everyday is more like a box hiding how it works, how it was made and how it might affect other living things: all we know is we put something in and something comes out. Most of the time this doesnt matter but in a complicated world where what we make and how we make it matters maybe we need to wonder what is behind the black boxes we use and what humans and non-humans are part of that.

In this golf hole a classic black box has a space for your decisions based on looking at microscopic algae and the people playing with you.

### Instructions

 * **Putt** the ball into the `IN` hole
  * Your ball will be held inside until you press the black or white button which represent a `success` or `fail`. Even the most elaborate algorithm is not a black box on it's own, but made by people.
 * Have a **look** down the microscopes provided
  * If your microscope does not work or you can't see anything visit `bit.ly/EuglenaSwim`
  * You will **see** tiny algae creatures called *Euglena gracilis* swimming in tiny channels made from the grooves of old vinyl records. This is a lesser known technique used by microbiologists in Lancaster University to observe tiny model organisms. simple creatures that teach biologists about how living things work.
* **Observe** how the creatures behave.
* **Act** out what you oberve with your body. Use the green Euglena Onesies (one Large, one Small) to help you!
 * Get someone playing with you to **judge** how well you do and press the **black** or **white** based on your performance.
 * **PRESS** **black** will send you on a more difficult putting course to the next hole.
 * ***PRESS** *white** Will send you to the easy route to the next hole!
 * Thanks for playing!
